AFTER ENTERING AT BREAK OF DAY THE INNER ROADSTEAD OF THE PORT OF
TOULON, EXCHANGING SEVERAL LOUD HAILS WITH ONE OF THE GUARDBOATS OF THE
FLEET, WHICH DIRECTED HIM WHERE HE WAS TO TAKE UP HIS BERTH,
MASTER-GUNNER PEYROL LET GO THE ANCHOR OF THE SEA-WORN AND BATTERED SHIP
IN HIS CHARGE, BETWEEN THE ARSENAL AND THE TOWN, IN FULL VIEW OF THE
PRINCIPAL QUAY. THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE, WHICH IN THE OPINION OF ANY
ORDINARY PERSON MIGHT HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS FULL OF MARVELLOUS INCIDENTS
(ONLY HE HIMSELF HAD NEVER MARVELLED AT THEM) HAD RENDERED HIM
UNDEMONSTRATIVE TO SUCH A DEGREE, THAT HE DID NOT EVEN LET OUT A SIGH OF
RELIEF AT THE RUMBLE OF THE CHAIN. AND YET IT ENDED A MOST ANXIOUS SIX
MONTHS OF KNOCKING ABOUT AT SEA WITH VALUABLE MERCHANDIZE IN A DAMAGED
HULL, MOST OF THE TIME ON SHORT RATIONS, ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR
ENGLISH CRUISERS, ONCE OR TWICE ON THE VERGE OF SHIPWRECK AND MORE THAN
ONCE ON THE VERGE OF CAPTURE. BUT AS TO THAT, OLD PEYROL HAD MADE UP HIS
MIND FROM THE FIRST TO BLOW UP HIS VALUABLE CHARGE--UNEMOTIONALLY, FOR
SUCH WAS HIS CHARACTER, FORMED UNDER THE SUN OF THE INDIAN SEAS IN
LAWLESS CONTESTS WITH HIS KIND FOR A LITTLE LOOT THAT VANISHED AS SOON
AS GRASPED, BUT MAINLY FOR BARE LIFE ALMOST AS PRECARIOUS TO HOLD
THROUGH ITS UPS AND DOWNS, AND WHICH NOW HAD LASTED FOR FIFTY-EIGHT
YEARS.
